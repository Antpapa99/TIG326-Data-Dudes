Install the webapp to make it work with Anaconda

conda install -c conda-forge dash-renderer 
conda install -c conda-forge dash 
conda install -c conda-forge dash-html-components 
conda install -c conda-forge dash-core-components
conda install -c conda-forge plotly

Install the webapp to make it work without
pip install dash-renderer
pip install dash  
pip install dash-html-components 
pip install dash-core-components
pip install plotly

for both you have to install dash bootstrap components like this
pip install dash-bootstrap-components

Note:Would be misleading to extremly_early_prototype.py an actual prototype, it was more or less a proof of concept as well familarising ourselves with Dash, Flask and using GIT in general
